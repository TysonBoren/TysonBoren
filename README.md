### PRIME OBJ

a simple way to track preventative maintenance for my motorcycle, store diagrams and links for sites I visit to buy parts or read forums etc. 

### USER STORIES

user should be able to log in/create account

user should be able to input motorcycle make/model/year

input completed maintenance/mileage to calculate next due date. Start with oil, spark plugs and add from there

store links to diagrams/vendors


cant store pics in data base, or images. either convert them to string. 
check out firebase, can auth, host, store images, store database

make a schedule for EACH item so you only focus on one thing a day till its completed.
